            It’s sometimes just too tempting to spend your free time playing games on your smartphone, or hanging out with your friends. That’s fun, for sure, but spending your time more constructively will provide you with more benefits in the long term.

            There’s really no excuse for saying, “I’m bored out of my mind,” given the many fun activities you can try. Choose any of the following activities and make the most out of your free time!

     <h2>
        Read a good novel, or a self-development book
     </h2>
     <p>
        Reading should be your go-to habit when you have free time on your hands. Reading expands your knowledge and keeps you up to date with new developments in your career. Not to mention that the news and knowledge you gain will make you an interesting person at parties and social gatherings!

        Utilize your free time for learning. It will help you professionally and personally. Create a free-time reading list and go back to it each time you’ve a few hours to kill.

        Keep your mind, knowledge, and memory sharp with a self-development book or biography, if fiction is not your cup of tea, and you’ll get two benefits in one.

        <p>
            If you think you’re as a good a writer as Shakespeare, why not make your own attempts at it?

            Even if you don’t, writing is an excellent way to spend some time. It doesn’t have to be anything formal you will submit to a publishing house. Do it for fun, do it to sharpen your writing skills, and nurture your creativity!
            
            Try guest blogging on anything you’re passionate and knowledgeable about — from Star Trek to the Kawaii Japanese culture. Live tweet a special TV or sport event or blog to get those thoughts and feelings out of your system and into the wider world.

                Cooking
            </h2>
            <p>
                Many people find cooking a creative, stress-releasing activity. Whether you’re a seasoned cook or a novice who is just starting to experiment with new foods, cooking can be an exhilarating experience.

                Try to see cooking as a stress-relieving activity instead of something you have to do every day. Take the opportunity to recreate some childhood classics – it might not be exactly like your mum’s lasagna, but just picture the satisfaction you’ll feel when you put that first mouthwatering cheese-dripping bite in your mouth.

                   Educational Technology For Struggling Learners

                <p>
                    The impact technology has had and will be having on education can never be truly measured. Apps, software, and several other technological innovations like Fast ForWard and Read 180 are now serving many struggling students across the globe helping them acquire the fundamental literacy skills of the 21st century: reading, writing, speaking skills, and touch typing.

                    From programs that are integrated in classes and help children process information more effectively and quickly, to software like 7 Speed Reading™ that help students improve their word per minute rate and read more in less time (and therefore reap all the benefits of reading), Ed Tech is at this very moment serving millions of people with their educational growth.
                    
                    From offering students reading motivation, to being able to use authentic speech patterns in ESL classrooms, to fully immersing students into the idiosyncrasies of English pronunciation through video and online media, the world of educational technology has come a long way.

                        Brain games are notorious for being addictive, just like other games, but these have a point. Get hooked on a brain game by choosing any game from a great online resource such as Lumosity.com and Fitbrains.com by Rosetta Stone. There are also various app-based ones like 92 Logic Games and Left Vs Right.
